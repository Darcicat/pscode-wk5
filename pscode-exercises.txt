// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

FUNCTION CheckEvenOdd(number)
IF number MOD 2 == 0 THEN
// MOD = modulo, which finds the remaineder when one integer is divided by another.//
PRINT "this is an even number."
// No remainder means an even number//
ELSE
PRINT "this is an odd number."
//remainder means an odd number//
END IF
END FUNCTION

declare variable "number" as an integer
input number
call CheckEvenOdd(number)



// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

(Your pseudocode here)
//A: Read in 5 separate numbers
DECLARE numbers AS ARRAY OF 5 INTEGERS
FOR i FROM 1 TO 5 DO
INPUT numbers[i]
END FOR

//B: Calculate the average
DECLARE sum as INTEGER
sum=0
FOR i FROM 1 TO 5 DO
sum = sum + numbers[i]
END FOR
DECLARE average AS FLOAT
average = sum / 5

//C: Find the smallest and largest

DECLARE min AS INTEGER
DECLARE max AS INTEGER
min = numbers[1]
max = numbers[1]
FOR i FROM 2 TO 5 DO
IF numbers[i] < min THEN
min = numbers[i]
END IF
IF numbers[i] > max THEN
max = numbers[i]
END IF
END FOR

//D: Output results
PRINT "average number:" + established variable (average)
PRINT "smallest number:" + established variable (min)
PRINT "largest number:" + established variable (max)
END
